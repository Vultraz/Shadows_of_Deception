For many years after the defeat of human and elvish forces at the hands of Black-Eye Kapou’e’, the Great Continent rested beneath a blanket of relative tranquility. Except for the occasional skirmish, the elvish, human, dwarvish, and orcish kingdoms were at peace. But it was not to last. Though none then knew, this was the beginning of the final age of Wesnoth.

The new king inherited a land throughout which seeds of disaster were sown rife, and, inexperienced as he was, could do naught to quash their blossoming. Unrest spread across the continent. Trade evaporated. To the northeast, Lintanir burned in the fires of civil war.

After driving back the outlaw incursion, we followed Aryon’s advice and crossed the Great River, traveling north to meet with the dwarves. Lord Myris lent us a few horses and men, and we made good time. I hoped the dwarves would indeed have some part of this puzzle. If not, well, I would just have to find Rhyan some other way."

She was like that, sometimes; just another quirk of her character, and indeed it seemed as if there might be something bigger at work after all. The bandit leader’s words might be taken by some to mean this extended further than we know. The evidence formed a trail, leading, at this point, halfway across the kingdom.
