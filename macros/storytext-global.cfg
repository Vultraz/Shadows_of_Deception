    _ "Some scenarios of this campaign work significantly different from normal Wesnoth gameplay. It is especially important to pay close attention to the mission objectives and not necessarily try to kill every single enemy, especially on shrouded maps, or in places where enemies seem to respawn continuously.

Also, this campaign incorporates many unique RPG elements. If get stuck, you can always read the <i>Campaign Help</i> option in the right-click menu." #enddef
