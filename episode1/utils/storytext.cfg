For many years after the defeat of human and elvish forces at the hands of Black-Eye Kapou’e’, the Great Continent rested beneath a blanket of relative tranquility. Excepting the occasional skirmish, the elvish, human, dwarvish, and orcish kingdoms were at peace. But it was not to last. Though none then knew, this was the beginning of the final age of Wesnoth. Its domain would expand one last time, before its definitive end in the fiery cataclysm that would mark the dawn of the Golden Age of Irdya."

            story= _ "In 1063 YW, a new king, Konrad III, acceded to the throne of Wesnoth. For several years, the peace that had endured for the past century had been shattering. Merchant caravans were hijacked, orcs and dwarves battled, outlying towns were sacked and burned. The new king inherited a land throughout which seeds of disaster were sown rife, and, inexperienced as he was, could do naught to quash their blossoming. Unrest spread across the continent. Trade evaporated. To the northeast, Lintanir burned in the fires of civil war. On the fringes of the Wesnothian empire, and even in the heartland, local lords ruled their fiefdoms as nations unto themselves, heeding not the edicts of the crown."

She taught me many things, and raised me as her own since my mother died. She was a great sorceress, skilled in the arts of faerie magic, and helped me greatly in my training. Though we traveled a good deal, nothing of very much importance happened during my early years. That all changed with the events that were about to occur, events which I will now relate. Hear now, my story."

We had become good friends in the preceding months. Though he was not an elf, he had shown quite an aptitude for archery almost on par with our own archers. We made quite a team, the three of us, traveling, hunting, fighting. I liked him. More than that, I owed him. He had saved me when I had, foolishly, let my guard down and allowed myself to be cornered by a pack of wolves. I would have been torn apart if not for his help.

And now, when he needed my help in return, I wasn’t there."

That was how she was — cool and calm in the face of danger, always dispatching whatever threat she faced cleanly and appearing none the worse for it later. But now the immediate threat was gone, and we were left with no clues to follow and no idea what course of action to take. On her advice, we quickly resupplied and hurried west, to Elensefar, to see a seer she knew. But when we got there, we found something unexpected."

            story= _ "Once, as we passed the western coast, I sat with Rhyan and watched the waves of the Great Ocean break upon the sand. It was unusually peaceful. Every elf knew the tales of the first human king, Haldric, making landfall with his forces from lands far to the west, bringing with them the orcish menace that would prove no small annoyance to the elves over the centuries. Rhyan knew the story, too; he was quite well versed in history. He was not a peasant, as I learned later, but son to the lord of a small town north of the Bay of Pearls. Niryone wasn’t exactly surprised."

Me? Countless theories swirled around my mind, each more unlikely than the last. All we could do was act, and so we did. After driving back the outlaw incursion, we followed Aryon’s advice and crossed the Great River, traveling north to meet with the dwarves. Lord Myris lent us a few horses and men, and we made good time. I hoped the dwarves would indeed have some part of this puzzle. If not, well, I would just have to find Rhyan some other way."

She had sensed a gathering storm and would not give up until she had followed it to the source. She was like that, sometimes; just another quirk of her character, and indeed it seemed as if there might be something bigger at work after all. The bandit leader’s words might be taken by some to mean this extended further than we know. The evidence formed a trail, leading, at this point, halfway across the kingdom. Hopefully we will find the next clue if we catch up to the party before they get too far north."

I wonder what her own theories on the matter are; mine continue to lack any semblance of logic or cohesion. An official of importance is impersonated, yet no hostile action seems to have come of it. Another person, my friend, is also taken. Outlaws invade Elensefar, seemingly with knowledge of the impostor before we had any inkling ourselves. And we helped drive them back. Perhaps Rhaldir was right. We are blind.

But to be honest, in the pages of this journal? My concern is what this means for Rhyan. Whatever fate they had planned for Myris could already have been his own. Let whoever is pulling the strings succeed with their schemes, just give me back my friend..."
