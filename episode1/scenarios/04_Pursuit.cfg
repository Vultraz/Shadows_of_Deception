I see a blasted landscape, burnt beneath the fiery gaze of two suns. Sand swirls underfoot as I walk... and walk... and walk. Towering ruins jut out from the ground like giant teeth, the only evidence life ever existed in this dead land. 

I look up and see the end of the desert, a cool, lush forest, familiar yet alien, drawing me forward. And I see it erupt in flames amidst a clash of blades and rivers of blood, seeping from the burning branches, the cackling of fire drowned by screams, so many screams....

Then it fades, and in the distance, I see two figures silhouetted against the searing sky. I see the light glisten off her red hair as she turns and pulls him close, and as their shadows entwine, a burst of warm light fills my sight before I wake from my slumber.</i>

The rest of the journal is rotted with age and unreadable."
